# Machine Learning and Inductive Inference
ML&II is a course of KU Leuven. This repository hosts a solution to the exam of 2015, to give insights on the exam format. The exam format is similar every year up till now. However there's no guarantee this will continue to be the case in the future.

The answers were realized through a collaborative effort of students: myself, Zimcke Van de Staey and Xavier Goas Aguililla. The document has been corrected over time, but there's still room for error.
